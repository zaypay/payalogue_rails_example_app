# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
# Product.create(:name => 'Cool Weapon',     :description => 'Great for battles', :price_setting_id => 123455, :payalogue_id => 456789)
# Product.create(:name => 'UberCool Weapon', :description => 'Win every battle' , :price_setting_id => 987654, :payalogue_id => 654321)
# puts "Finish seeding homies!!!!!"
